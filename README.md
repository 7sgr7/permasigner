# How does it work?
In 14.0-15.4.1, there is a bug where CoreTrust will allow any root certificate. 

This script makes a deb file for you based on an IPA. Tested only with Taurine, but should work with many others.

This is especially useful for 14.0-14.2.1 users who don't have a permanently signed jailbreak (eg. unc0ver + Fugu14).

# Prerequsites
1. Mac OS X 10.5.0 (?) or later, personally tested on macOS 13.0 OR Debian based Linux
    - Both codesign and ldid can be used on macOS.
    - Arch based Linux won't work (yet) since it doesn't have dpkg
2. Jailbroken iDevice on 14.0-14.8.1

# How to use
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/itsnebulalol/permasigner`
2. Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Edit the app's entitlements in `app.entitlements`
    - If not sure, keep it how it is, it may work.
    - Some apps like Dolphin have custom entitlements to use.
4. Install dpkg using brew
5. Run the script
    - If you'd like the script to use codesign instead, pass `-c` or `--codesign`
6. Install the newly created deb file
7. Reboot to stock, the app will still work!
8. ??
9. Profit?

# In Progress
- [ ] Pull entitlements from binary
    - Only works on signed binaries...
- [ ] Download dpkg-deb like how we did with ldid so it works with other Linux distros
- [ ] Ask to install automatically on connected device
    - Would require using something like iProxy
- [x] Switch to ldid for possible Linux support
    - Maybe Procursus strapped iDevices too, if necessary pip packages are compiled for iPhoneOS
