# How does it work?
In 14.0-15.4.1, there is a bug where CoreTrust will allow any root certificate. 

This script makes a deb file for you based on any IPA. Tested with Taurine and Odyssey.

# Prerequsites
1. Mac OS 10.5.0 (?) or higher, personally tested on 13.0
2. Jailbroken iDevice on 14.0-14.8.1
