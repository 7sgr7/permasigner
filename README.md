# How does it work?
In 14.0-15.4.1, there is a bug where CoreTrust will allow any root certificate. 

This script makes a deb file for you based on an IPA. Tested with Taurine and Odyssey, but should work with many others.

This is especially useful for 14.0-14.2.1 users who don't have a permanently signed jailbreak (eg. unc0ver + Fugu14).

# Prerequsites
1. Mac OS 10.5.0 (?) or higher, personally tested on 13.0
2. Jailbroken iDevice on 14.0-14.8.1

# How to use
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/itsnebulalol/permasigner`
2. Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Edit the app's entitlements in `app.entitlements`
4. Install dpkg using brew
5. Run the script
6. Install the newly created deb file
7. Reboot to stock, the app will still work!
