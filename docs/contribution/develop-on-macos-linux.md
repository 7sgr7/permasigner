# Develop on macOS/Linux

NOTE: If you missed [Getting Started](getting-started.md), go ahead and read it.

Since you installed VSCode and cloned your fork, you can now open it!

## Open Cloned Repo in VSCode

Since we're using VSCode in this tutorial, we'll show you how to set it up.

* Open up VSCode, click the open folder button, and select the directory you cloned earlier
* Follow [VSCode Setup](visual-studio-code-setup.md), then come back

You can use `python3 main.py` in the cloned directory to start Permasigner. We recommend using VSCode's integrated terminal.

Check out [Important Files](important-files.md) to see which files handle what, and look at [Committing and making a Pull Request](committing-and-making-a-pull-request.md) for your next steps.
